##Filtering Rows and Columns

Suppose we want to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write:

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"select playerID,teamID,yearID,HR from Batting
where teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"

sqldf(query)
```


Suppose we want to find all insances of Phillies in the 1970s hitting more than 30 homeruns:

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"select playerID,teamID,yearID,HR from Batting
where teamID='PHI' and HR>30 and yearID>=1970 and yearID<1980"

sqldf(query)
```


Finding all the Yankees that hit greater than 40 homeruns we could write the following code:

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR>=40"

sqldf(query)
```

Suppose we want to find all the instances where a player had more than 40 homeruns but less than 60 strikeouts.

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"select playerID,teamID,yearID,HR,SO from Batting
where HR>40 and SO<60"

sqldf(query)
```


##Order By

With SQL we can also order the rows in the output. For example; suppose we want to see every instance of a player hitting more than 50 HR but youd like the player with the most HR to be at the top. Do the following:

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"select playerID,yearID,teamID,HR from Batting 
where HR>50
order by HR desc"

sqldf(query)
```

##Aggregation

With SQL we can squash chunks of data together to get things such as sumations,averages,maximuns, and minimums. For example; Suppose we want to find what players have the highest average per season Hoomerun totals, Listing only those with averages greater than 30.

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-" select playerID, avg(HR) from Batting
group by playerID
having avg(HR)>30
order by avg(HR) desc"

sqldf(query)
```

##Joins

Find the first and last names along with TeamID, YearID, HR, Player should be babe ruth:

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT namefirst, namelast, teamID, YearID
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master
ON Batting.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE Batting.playerID='ruthba01'"

sqldf(query)
```

Find all instances of players hitting more than 50 HR:

```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"select namefirst,namelast,teamID,YearID, HR
From Batting INNER JOIN Master
On Batting.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"

sqldf(query)
```

Babe Ruth with player ID, Team name, year, and HR
```{r message=FALSE,Warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT playerID,name,Batting.yearID,Batting.HR
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Teams
On Batting.TeamID=teams.teamID and Batting.yearID=Teams.yearID
Where playerID='ruthba01'"

sqldf(query)
```
